Create a program that displays how many times a word appears in a file, or across files.  The program will be seeded with an input file where each line in this file, is another file’s relative path.  Each file within the input file, will contain the words needed to be tracked. User should be able to run the program and see a list of all the words and their respective counts. The program will need to quickly handle 1000’s lines in the input file and display results in a timely manner.
